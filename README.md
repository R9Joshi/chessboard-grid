# Chessboard using CSS Grid

This project is a simple chessboard built using the **CSS Grid** layout. I created this while learning the `display: grid` property in my web development course.

## Project Details:
- **Grid Layout**: The chessboard is structured using an 8x8 grid, where alternating `div` elements represent black and white squares.
- **Responsive Design**: The chessboard is placed in the center of the webpage using Flexbox for horizontal and vertical centering.
- **Progress**: I am currently in the process of learning CSS Grid, and this project is an exercise to understand the grid structure.
